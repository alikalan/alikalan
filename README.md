## About Me

I am a process engineer with a master's degree from TU Dortmund. I worked at a company focused on using AI to reduce energy consumption in the real estate sector for six years up to 2024. This experience has sparked my interest in expanding my skills beyond traditional process engineering. I am now seeking opportunities to integrate my engineering background with my newly acquired skills in data science and machine learning.
